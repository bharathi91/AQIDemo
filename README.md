# AQIDemo

I have used MVVM architecture for this project.
To connect to the socket i have used Socket-IO   https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift
I have also used UNSplash Public API's for downloading city images. 
For charts, i have used "Charts" library  https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts

ScreenShots and demo video i have attached in a google f=drive folder. Here's the link.
