# AQIDemo

I have used MVVM architecture for this project.
To connect to the socket i have used Socket-IO   https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift

Initially i was facing issue in connecting to the scoket. Then o tried a browser extension fpor Socket connection to verify.
Then i have gone through the SocketIO-iOS library, and they have an option to allow unsecured socket connection. While configuring the Socket manager, we will have to enable the option. So i proceeded with that.


I have also used UNSplash Public API's for downloading city images. 
For charts, i have used "Charts" library  https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts

ScreenShots and demo video i have attached in a public google drive folder. Here's the link.
