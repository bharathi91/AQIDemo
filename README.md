# AQIDemo

I have used MVVM architecture for this project.
To connect to the socket i have used Socket-IO   https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift
I have also used UNSplash Public API's for downloading city images. 
For charts, i have used "Charts" library  https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts
I have attached the screenshots and the demo video in a folder named demo in the repository.
Thanks.
